### 🎨 Unity & Blender Support  

Although **Craftland Studio** does not directly support **Unity** or **Blender**, they can still be useful for certain aspects of development:

Blender can be used to create and edit **custom 3D models** for Craftland Studio. You can:  
- Design 3D objects such as buildings, props, and characters  
- Apply textures and optimize models for performance  
- Export models in **.FBX** or **.OBJ** format for possible Craftland Studio import  

> ⚠ **Note:** Importing 3D models into Craftland Studio may require conversion or additional adjustments.  

#### 🎮 **Unity (Game Logic & Scene Prototyping)**
Unity can be used to prototype and visualize your game ideas before building them in Craftland Studio. You can:  
- Create and test game logic using C#  
- Prototype animations and behavior trees  
- Design complex scenes before manually recreating them in Craftland  

> ⚠ **Note:** Unity projects cannot be directly imported into Craftland Studio, but **scripts and logic** can be adapted.
